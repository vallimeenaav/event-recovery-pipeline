# 📝 Write-Up: Summary, Trade-offs, Scalability, and Alternative Approaches


## Summary of My Approach & Why I Chose It

Linq’s system operates in an **event-driven architecture**, meaning real-time event processing is critical for business operations. However, failures in event processing—such as **missed, duplicated, or incorrectly processed events**—can lead to inaccurate CRM updates, incorrect sales tracking, failed AI-powered follow-ups, and poor customer experience.  

Since I **don’t have access to historical logs or a traditional database**, my approach relies on **real-time inference techniques and event validation mechanisms** to recover and back-calculate missing or incorrect data.  

### 🚀 Key Features of My Approach:
✔ **Detects missing events dynamically** (Event ID gaps, downstream validation, anomaly detection).  
✔ **Prevents duplicate processing** (Idempotency, deduplication, DLQs).  
✔ **Corrects calculation errors** (Cross-system validation, rebuilding corrupted data).  
✔ **Ensures financial accuracy** (Real-time currency validation, Stripe API revenue checks).  
✔ **Scales efficiently** (Google Cloud Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run).

## 🛠 Trade-Offs & Limitations

While this approach ensures **real-time event recovery**, there are certain **trade-offs and limitations**:  

### Inference-Based Recovery is Not 100% Foolproof 
- Since **historical logs are unavailable**, the system must infer missing data dynamically.  
- **Example:** If a **business card scan event** is missing, we can’t always determine what data was lost.  
- **Mitigation:** Downstream validation helps, but there may still be **edge cases** where manual intervention is required.  

### Potential Latency in Reprocessing Events
- If **millions of events** are flagged for reprocessing at once, it could cause **temporary delays**.  
- **Mitigation:** The system prioritizes urgent event corrections and **scales dynamically** using Cloud Run.  

### External API Dependency
- Since my approach relies on **external APIs** (Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, OpenExchangeRates) for validation, **any downtime in these services** can delay corrections.  
- **Mitigation:** Implementing **retry logic and failover mechanisms** ensures the system remains functional even if APIs fail temporarily.  

*Despite these trade-offs, the system is designed to minimize failures while maintaining high accuracy.*

## ⚡ How My Approach Would Change with More Tools (e.g., Database, Logs, etc.)

If **historical logs** or a **traditional database** were available, my approach would be more **straightforward** and even **more accurate**.  

### Database for Event Replay 
- Instead of **inferring missing events**, I could **replay past events** directly from a database like **BigQuery, Firebase, or PostgreSQL**.  
- **Example:** If an AI follow-up email was not sent, I could **query past event logs** and trigger the correct follow-up instead of estimating what should have happened.  

### Transaction Logging for Enhanced Debugging 
- Instead of only detecting anomalies in real-time, I could **store a detailed transaction history** to pinpoint exactly where failures occurred.  
- This would reduce the need for **anomaly detection models** in BigQuery ML and instead allow **direct lookups** for corrections.  

### Event Store for Better State Management
- Implementing an **event store** (e.g., Kafka, Google Cloud Spanner) would allow me to **store event states** for better tracking.  
- This would remove the need for **complex inference techniques** when detecting missing events.

## 📈 Scalability: How My Approach Handles Millions of Events Per Hour

📌 [**Refer to the Detailed Approach section for full scalability details.**](##📈-ensuring-scalability:-processing-millions-of-events-per-hour)  

However, in summary:  

✔ **Google Cloud Dataflow (Apache Beam)** → Parallel event processing at scale.  
✔ **Cloud Functions** → Event-driven validation with minimal compute cost.  
✔ **Cloud Run** → Auto-scales to reprocess events dynamically.  
✔ **BigQuery ML** → Anomaly detection without the need for historical logs.  
✔ **Pub/Sub Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)** → Ensures failed events are not lost and can be reprocessed safely.  

*By leveraging serverless GCP services, this solution dynamically scales based on traffic, ensuring real-time event recovery at high throughput.*

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

- My approach **fully aligns with Linq’s event-driven system** by handling failures dynamically.  
- It ensures **accuracy without historical logs** through validation, inference, and external API checks.  
- The solution is **scalable, cost-effective, and built on industry best practices**.  
- With access to a database, improvements could be made, but the current approach **effectively addresses all the key problems while maintaining high availability**.
