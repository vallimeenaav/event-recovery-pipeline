# event-recovery-pipeline
This repository contains a scalable event recovery pipeline that detects, back-calculates, and corrects missing, duplicate, and incorrectly processed events in an event-driven system. The solution ensures real-time event validation, deduplication, and anomaly detection without relying on historical logs or a traditional database.
