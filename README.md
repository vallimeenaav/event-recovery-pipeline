# 🚀 EVENT RECOVERY & REPROCESSING IN A REAL-TIME SYSTEM

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides a solution for a **scalable event recovery pipeline** to detect, back-calculate, and correct **missing, duplicate, and incorrectly processed events** in an event-driven system. The solution ensures real-time event validation, deduplication, and anomaly detection **without relying on historical logs or a traditional database**.

## 🛠 Problem Statement
Linq's platform operates in an event-driven architecture, where actions like **business card scans, CRM syncs, AI-powered follow-ups, and sales tracking** rely on real-time event processing. However, event failures—such as **missed, duplicated, or incorrectly processed events**—can disrupt business operations and customer experience. [these details are assumed]

### 🎯 Solution Highlights
- ✅ Detects & recovers missing events using event ID gaps, downstream validation, and anomaly detection.
- 🔄 Prevents duplicate processing with idempotency keys, deduplication checks, and dead-letter queues.
- 🔧 Corrects incorrectly processed events through cross-system validation, real-time recalculations, and API lookups.
- ⚡ Scalable architecture leveraging serverless functions, streaming tools, and parallel processing for high-volume events.
