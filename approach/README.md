# 🚀 Detailed Approach

I’ve come up with the following detailed approach after researching Linq’s current solutions, event-driven architecture, different data engineering methodologies, and a deep dive into Google Cloud Services (for scalability) (assuming we work with GCP).  

Linq’s platform runs on an event-driven system, where actions like scanning business cards, sending AI-powered follow-ups, CRM syncs, and sales tracking (assumption) are all powered by real-time event processing. But when something goes wrong—like events being missed, duplicated, or processed incorrectly—it can cause serious problems for both users and business operations.  

After thinking through various possibilities, I put together a few key scenarios where event processing failures could occur. These issues could show up across different parts of Linq’s system, from lead management to store transactions. Here’s an overview of what I identified (these are my general assumptions—my approach and solution are based on this):  

    ⚠️ **Missed or duplicate business card scans** → Leads might not get created or updated in the CRM.  
    ⚠️ **AI-powered follow-ups not getting triggered correctly** → Some messages (emails, texts, or push notifications) might not get sent, while others get spammed multiple times.  
    ⚠️ **CRM sync errors** → Contact records end up missing or duplicated across different CRMs (or, for example, a bug causing field information to be swapped - say between email and phone number).  
    ⚠️ **Smart tagging failures** → Leads might not get classified properly (misclassified or untagged).  
    ⚠️ **iMessage automation issues** → Some users might not get their follow-ups at the right time.  
    ⚠️ **Miscalculated performance metrics (misreported analytics)** → Call volume, message counts, call durations might be off, leading to inaccurate tracking for the customer.  
    ⚠️ **Duplicate discount codes** → Some users get multiple discount codes when they should only get one (through the Ambassador Program in Linq One app).  
    ⚠️ **Incorrect revenue tracking** → Store sales are calculated wrong due to currency conversion errors.  

Since these problems all stem from event processing failures, I would design a universal solution that can handle:  
✔ **Missing events** – Some events were never processed.  
✔ **Duplicate events** – Some events got processed multiple times.  
✔ **Incorrectly processed events** – Some events ran but had wrong calculations or bad mappings.  

However, as the instructions state: **I don’t have access to historical logs or a traditional database** to store event history. That means I can’t just “look back” and replay lost events. Instead, I have to infer what’s missing or incorrect in real-time.

## **Tools, Strategies, and Techniques to Use**

To solve this, I propose a scalable and self-correcting event recovery system that detects, back-calculates, and prevents errors by leveraging real-time validation techniques, caching, and event reprocessing mechanisms.  

### **[Quick Appendix: Tools Used]**

- **Google Cloud Dataflow (Apache Beam)** → Used for real-time event stream processing, dependency validation, and error detection.  
- **Google Cloud Functions** → Used for lightweight event validation, missing event recovery, and cross-system verification.  
- **Google Cloud Run** → Used for dynamically scaling event reprocessing workloads.  
- **Google Pub/Sub** → Used for messaging between services, deduplication, and managing event ordering.  
- **BigQuery ML** → Used for anomaly detection in event streams to identify missing or incorrectly processed events.

## **🛠 How I Will Recover and Back-Calculate the Missing/Incorrect Data?**

### **✅ 0. Pre-Validation Before Reprocessing**
Before any flagged event is reprocessed, a format validation check is applied using Cloud Functions and Dataflow to ensure:
- All required fields exist (e.g., `event_id`, `timestamp`, `event_type`, `data`).  
- Timestamps are valid (not missing, outdated, or future-dated).  
- Numeric fields (e.g., `amount`, `duration`) are properly formatted.  
- If an event fails validation, it is flagged for manual review instead of being reprocessed.  

### **✅ 1. Detecting Missing Events**
Since logs are not available, missing events will be inferred using:

📌 **Event ID Gaps Detection (Pub/Sub Event Ordering)**  
- If event IDs are sequential but missing a number (e.g., `1001 → 1002 → 1004`), a Cloud Function will detect the gap and trigger reprocessing.  

📌 **Downstream Validation (Dataflow & Cloud Functions)**  
- If an event triggers dependent actions (e.g., `Lead Created` → `CRM Sync` → `AI Follow-Up`) but the next action didn’t occur, the lead creation event was presumably lost.  
- Dataflow will cross-check dependencies and reprocess the missing event.
- The missing event will either be sent for reprocessing or be logged for manual intervention by a cloud function. 

📌 **Dynamic Anomaly-Based Detection (Dataflow + BigQuery ML)**  
- Analyze event trends in real time (e.g., “Linq typically processes ~85% of scanned business cards into CRM entries” – if this drops, flag missing events).
- Use BigQuery ML anomaly detection to dynamically adjust expectations based on time of day, seasonality, and user activity levels.
- A Cloud Dataflow pipeline detects when event volumes drop significantly compared to historical data.  

### **✅ 2. Handling Duplicate Events**
Duplicate events must not distort results. Can prevent this by:

📌 **Idempotency Keys (Pub/Sub Message Attributes)** 
- Every event is assigned a unique fingerprint (UUID) so that duplicate processing doesn’t affect results.
- The subscriber (Cloud Function or Cloud Run) checks the UUID against a short-term storage system (like Redis) to see if it has been processed before.

📌 **Deduplication at Entry Point (Cloud Functions + Cloud Run)** 
- When an event arrives, a Cloud Function runs a quick duplicate check. Events with the same timestamp and source are flagged before processing.
- If an event is identical to one received milliseconds earlier, it is flagged and discarded before further processing. Else, it is passed to Cloud Run for processing at scale.

📌 **Pub/Sub Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for Auto-Correction** 
- If a duplicate event was already processed, Pub/Sub stores it in a Dead Letter Queue instead of processing it again.
- The DLQ acts as a backup, storing events that should not be retried.
- A Cloud Function listens to the DLQ and checks if an event should be permanently discarded or manually reviewed.

### **✅ 3. Correcting Incorrectly Processed Events**
If events were processed incorrectly due to calculation errors, need to recalculate and correct them dynamically.

📌 **Cross-System Validation (Dataflow + API Verification)** 
- Compare Linq’s internal data with external APIs (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe, Twilio) [assuming there exists External systems that store customer relationship (CRM), payment, and communication data.]
- Cloud Dataflow continuously streams Linq’s event data and compares it with these external sources. It queries external APIs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe, Twilio) to check for inconsistencies.
- *Example: Payment Processing Validation (Comparing Linq & Stripe Records)
Linq’s system says John Doe made a $100 purchase at 12:00 PM, but Stripe’s API says the transaction failed.
Dataflow detects this mismatch and flags the event for reprocessing.
If CRM data doesn’t match Linq’s internal records, flag for correction.*

📌 **Rebuilding Corrupted Data (Cloud Run for Reprocessing)** 
- If an event was processed incorrectly, the next step is to query real-time APIs and recalculate the correct values dynamically using cloud run. The corrected data is then re-inserted into the event pipeline to update Linq’s records.

### **✅ 4. Fixing Revenue & Currency Conversion Errors**
If sales revenue tracking is incorrect, need to validate and correct it automatically.

📌 **Real-time Currency Conversion Validation (Dataflow + OpenExchangeRates API)** 
- Every transaction amount in Pub/Sub is checked against real-time exchange rates using an external API by dataflow.
- It recalculates what the expected revenue should be in USD. If the USD revenue ≠ expected converted amount, flag for correction.

📌 **Automated Revenue Validation (Cloud Functions + Stripe API)**
- Cloud Function is triggered when Dataflow detects a revenue discrepancy.
- It cross-checks Linq’s store sales data against payment processor data (e.g., Stripe API or PayPal).
- If the recorded revenue deviates by more than 5%, it gets flagged for triggering auto-reprocessing.

### **✅ 5. Fixing Misreported Sales & Call Tracking**
📌 **Sales Tracking Validation (Dataflow + Pub/Sub Event Matching)** 
- Cloud Dataflow listens to all sales transactions in Pub/Sub. Ensure price × quantity = revenue before storing the event.
- Use historical trend analysis to detect misreported sales totals (unusually high or low sales amounts), then flag it.

📌 **Call Duration Validation (Cloud Functions + Twilio API Sync)** 
- Cloud Function is triggered when a new call event is recorded in Linq’s system. Compare recorded call duration in Linq vs. actual call logs from Twilio/Google Voice APIs.
- If the call exists but duration = 0s, remove the event or flag it for correction.

## **📈 Ensuring Scalability: Processing Millions of Events Per Hour**
To ensure the highest accuracy in recalculating missing, duplicate, or incorrect events, I have suggested multiple validation mechanisms:

✔ Format Validation Before Reprocessing
- Before any flagged event is reprocessed, a Cloud Function validates that all required fields exist, timestamps are valid, and numeric fields are properly formatted.
- This prevents corrupt or incomplete events from being reintroduced into the system.

✔ Sanity Checks Before Reprocessing:
- Every recalculated event undergoes format validation (e.g., timestamps, payload structure, required fields).
- Example: Before retrying a missed CRM Sync, the system checks whether the lead was actually created.

✔ Cross-System Data Consistency Verification:
- Before overwriting any records, Linq’s data is cross-checked with external APIs (HubSpot, Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio).
- Example: A failed payment event is reprocessed only if Stripe confirms the charge failed (avoiding double charges).

✔ Idempotency to Prevent Overcorrection:
- Every recalculated event carries a unique UUID to ensure it is not applied multiple times (prevents overcorrection).

✔ Auto-Reconciliation via Anomaly Detection:
- If a recalculated value significantly deviates from historical trends, it is flagged for manual review instead of automatic correction.
- Example: If a revenue recalculation unexpectedly increases sales by 300%, it is held for manual validation.

✔ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for Safe Replays:
- Incorrectly processed events are first stored in a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) before being modified, ensuring safe rollback if needed.

## **📌 Alternative Approaches & Why I Chose My Solution**
While designing this solution, I considered a few alternatives for some of the tasks in my solution:

### **1️⃣ Alternative: Assigning a Unique "Event State Tracker" Instead of Inference-Based Recovery**

Approach:
- Instead of inferring missing events dynamically (via downstream validation and anomaly detection), I could have assigned a temporary “state tracker” to each event and updated its status at each stage.
- Each event would have an associated lifecycle (e.g., “created,” “processed,” “completed”).
- If an event fails to transition to the next state within a given time, it is assumed missing.

Why I Didn’t Choose This:
- This would require temporary storage (in-memory cache like Redis) to track event states, which increases overhead and complexity.
- Linq’s event system is already asynchronous, meaning events do not always process in a strict order. A missing state transition might not always indicate a failure (e.g., delays due to network latency).
- My chosen method (downstream validation + anomaly detection) avoids unnecessary state tracking overhead while still ensuring correctness.

### **2️⃣ Alternative: Using a Rule-Based Heuristic for Anomaly Detection Instead of ML-Based Detection**

Approach:
- Instead of using BigQuery ML for anomaly detection, I could have implemented a rule-based threshold system.
- Example: If the system typically processes 85% of scanned business cards into CRM entries, but today only 50% are recorded, the system flags an issue.
- This would be cheaper and simpler to implement than an ML-based approach.

Why I Didn’t Choose This:
- Rule-based heuristics don’t adapt well to dynamic changes (e.g., user behavior changes over time, seasonal traffic, promotional events).
- BigQuery ML learns patterns automatically and adjusts expectations dynamically instead of using hardcoded thresholds.
- A rule-based approach might generate too many false positives or false negatives, requiring constant tuning.

### **3️⃣ Alternative: Delaying Reprocessing Instead of Immediate Event Correction**

Approach:
- Instead of immediately reprocessing events once a failure is detected, I could have implemented a delay-based approach where flagged events are stored in a queue and only retried after a certain cooldown period (e.g., 5 minutes).
- This would help avoid redundant reprocessing in case of temporary network failures or minor delays in event handling.

Why I Didn’t Choose This:
- Linq’s system requires real-time event correction. Delaying reprocessing would mean CRM syncs, AI follow-ups, and revenue tracking remain incorrect for a longer period, affecting business operations.
- Pub/Sub Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) already provide a retry mechanism, ensuring events are retried efficiently.
- My approach prioritizes immediate correction while avoiding unnecessary retries using idempotency checks to prevent duplicate processing.
